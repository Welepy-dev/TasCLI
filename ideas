I am pretty new in programming, I am studying programming at 42 ecole which is mainly in C.

I want to learn also python, so I came up with an idea to learn by:\
I want to create a To-do app inside the terminal, I've chosen python for the development of this project, with the textual Framework.

Tell what I should learn first to do this project, I'm quite familiar with the basics of python such as Functions, Variables, Conditionals, Loops, Exceptions, Libraries, Unit Tests, File I/O, and Regular Expressions.

This is what I want to implement in this project:

- First, a window with the list of all the tasks to do, with a box a the right which is basically a text editor where you can read and edit the details of the task, of course this text editor must be able to make the text bold or italic, format it, make bulleted lists, numbered lists, checkboxes etc.
- in the box with all the tasks the user will be able to order by priority.
- Vim-like motion.
- Define state of the task (pending, overdue, done etc).
- Render different color text in the text editor.
- Select various tasks.
- In the command line, the program should be able to run certain commands like : create task, remove task, solve task etc.
- Color Themes.
- Be able to add.
- Search tasks.
- Show how many tasks are pending, active, done
- Have a checkbox in the list of tasks mark as done.
- A footer with info and shortcuts.
- Be able to write the task in the command line withÂ  a multilevel prompt.

Future features to implement:

- Clock and calendar.
- Notify the user.
- Show images.
- Able to show tables.

The name will be TasCLI.

How can I develop and deploy this to be available to install via pip and a package manager e. g.: pacman?

Hot can I make the command line be able to autocomplete the commands?

Do you want a picture of the concept?
